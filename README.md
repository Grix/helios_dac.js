# helios_dac.js
Implementation of the Helios DAC sdk using webUSB.
The Helios DAC from bitlasers is a pretty capable open source DAC. It connects to any show laser via the standard ILDA interface and is controlled via USB.
This means that my browser based show laser software can power the laser directly.

Don't get excited, it's not working yet but I am confident it will get there.
